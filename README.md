This repository contains supplementary code, data and model descriptions to
reproduce the simulations in the manuscript.

## Set-up of computational environment

Reproducing the simulations requires a working Python 3 (>=3.8) environment 
with the Jupyter Notebook and a selection of libraries for scientific computation.
It is best set up in a separate virtual environment using the requirement
specifications provided, either for Anaconda, or using `pip` in a normal Python environment.

### Anaconda Python distribution

By far the easiest way to set up the environment is using
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Dependencies are installed automatically.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate barry-prx
pip install identifiability
```

### Using Python and `pip`

The simulations require the use of the `CVODE` solver, which is provided by the `Assimulo` Python package. 
Unfortunately the Assimulo version on PyPI is *severely outdated*, so the package cannot be installed 
with `pip`, but has to be compiled and built by hand 
(see [Assimulo install documentation](https://jmodelica.org/assimulo/installation.html)).

Once Assimulo is built and installed, the other requirements can be installed with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note, however, that installation with `conda` (see above) is by far the easier option. See also 
[PySCeS installation instructions](https://pyscesdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide_doc.html#installing-and-configuring).

## Writing the models in the paper

The models which form part of the text are provided as input files for PySCeS and SBML; however, since 
the algorithm to enumerate the peroxidase reactions of peroxiredoxin forms part of the main text,
the scripts to enumerate these reactions are provided here together with scripts to generate PySCeS input files for all models in the paper.
To produce the models, execute the Jupyter notebooks in the following 
folders in sequence. The notebooks are annotated and documented to explain
what is being done.

    - **Analysis:** Enumerates the peroxidase reactions of Prx decamers using the algorithm described in the text.
    - **Writes:** Prx decamer peroxidase reactions _without_ hyperoxidation (`Prx decamer reactions - no hyperoxidation.txt`).
    - **Writes:** Prx decamer peroxidase reactions _with_ hyperoxidation (`Prx decamer reactions - with hyperoxidation.txt`).

2. `write_models`
    - **Requires:** Prx decamer peroxidase reactions _with_ hyperoxidation and Prx decamer peroxidase reactions _without_ hyperoxidation.
    - **Requires:** RBC PRDX2 Model A (`RBC_PRDX2_modelA.psc`).
    - **Writes:** Prx dimer-decamer equilibrium model (`Prx_dim-dec.psc`).
