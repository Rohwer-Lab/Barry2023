This repository contains supplementary code, data and model descriptions to
reproduce the simulations in the manuscript.

## Set-up of computational environment

Reproducing the simulations requires a working Python 3 (>=3.8) environment 
with the Jupyter Notebook and a selection of libraries for scientific computation.
It is best set in a separate virtual environment using the requirement
specifications provided, either for Anaconda, or using `pip` in a normal Python enviroment.

### Anaconda Python distribution

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
pip install identifiability
```

### Using Python and `pip`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reproducing the simulations in the paper

To reproduce the simulations, execute the Jupyter notebooks in the following 
folders in sequence. The notebooks are annotated and documented to explain
what is being done.
